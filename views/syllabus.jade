      h2(class="project-title") Course Description 
      p This course is designed to be an introductory programming course where students
        | are taught the foundational concepts involved in software development. No coding experience is required and 
        | students with coding experience will be encouraged to adopt good clean coding practices in this course.
      p This is a 3 unit course, so students will be expected to spend at least 6 hours per week outside of class working 
        | on course content.
      h2(class="project-title") Learning Outcomes

      p I would like this class to be a discussion-type experience. If you have a question, immediately ask. If you're 
        | not understanding the example I'm using, please ask for another, or for a different approach. Coming to class should 
        | be an interactive experience between your peers and myself.

      h2(class="project-title") Assignments
      p There will be an assignment every one to two weeks. You may work with a partner on your homework assignments, 
        | but if you do so, you must clearly state both names upon submission and all problems must be completed in a 
        | peer-programming manner. Do not split the problems between partners.
      p Homework should be submitted via email by the beginning of the class as well as a hard copy brought into class. 
        |Late assignments will not be accepted. 

      h2(class="project-title") Participation/Attendance
      p I will monitor much of your understanding of the content of this course based on your 
        | participation in class. So come to class, be active and engaged.

      h2(class="project-title") Academic Honesty
      p Academic dishonesty will be treated as an extremely serious matter with severe consequences that can
        | range from receiving no credit for assignments/tests, failing the class, to expulsion. It is never permissible 
        | to turn in any work that has not been authored by the student, such as work that has been copied from another student 
        | or copied from a source (including Internet) without properly acknowledging the source. It is your responsibility to 
        | make sure that your work meets the standard of academic honesty set forth in the “LMU Honor Code and Process” which 
        | appears in the LMU 
        a(href="http://bulletin.lmu.edu" target="_blank") Bulletin
      p Students who turn in work that is not their own will receive a zero on that assignment.

      h2(class="project-title") Special Accommodations
      p Students with special needs who require reasonable modifications, special assistance, or
        | accommodations in this course should promptly direct their request to the Disability Support Services (DSS) Office. Any
        | student who currently has a documented disability (ADHD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Learning, Physical, or Psychiatric)
        | needing academic accommodations should contact the DSS Office (Daum Hall 2nd floor, 310-338-4216) as early in the
        | semester as possible. All discussions will remain confidential. Please visit 
        a(href="http://www.lmu.edu/dss" target="_blank") DSS 
        | for additional information.

      h2(class="project-title") Tentative Nature of the Syllabus
